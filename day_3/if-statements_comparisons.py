# if-else statements

# basic if-else statement rule:
if condition_is_True:
    print("do something")
else:
    print("do something else if not True")

# What can into them:

# 1:
if condition_is_true:
    print("do something if condition is true. if not don't do anything")

# 2.
if condition_is_true:
    print("do something if condition is true.")
else:
    print("do something else if not True")

# 3.
if condition_is_true:
    print("do something if condition is true.")
    print("also do this, since it's also within the if statement block.")
elif first_condition_not_true:
    print("do this 2nd thing")
elif second_condition_not_true:
    print("do this 3rd thing")
    print("\nalso, we can have as many 'elif' statements as we want/need "
          "within the same if-elif-else block")
else:
    print("if conditions in if statement or elif statements not true"
          " do action in else")
