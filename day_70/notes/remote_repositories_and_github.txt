Remote Repositories

A remote repository is repository that hosted on someone else's server or computer.
There are a few websites that offer remote repository services, usually for free for
the most part. The most popular of these is GitHub.


Steps to Create a Remote Repository - GitHub will be used as an example
(GitHub account needed)

1. On GitHub, create remote repository (when committed, files from local repository
   will be stored here. Give this a name, a description and decide to make the
   repository public or private. Also decide to initialise repository with README
   file (this doesn't need to be done now as we can push one of these files to the
   remote repository later)

2. Decide on how to set up the remote repository. This can be done either with GitHubs
   desktop client or via the command-line with GitHubs instructions.

   Type in 'git remote add origin <remote repository link>' (link is provided by
   GitHub) and enter.
   Then type in 'git push -u master' (GitHubs new convention is 'main', not 'master')
   and enter.
   The 'master'/'main' refers the main default branch for the repository.
   This step will send everything in the local repository to the remote repository.
