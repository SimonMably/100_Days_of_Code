The 'display' property has 4 different values; block, inline, inline-block, none.

block:
  Block elements are elements that take up the entire width of the web pages screen,
  essentially blocking other elements from being displayed directly next to them.

  Elements that have the 'block' display property are so by default.
  Examples of block elements; paragraph tags (<p>), heading/header tags (<h1>, <h2>, etc),
  divisions (<div>), lists and list items (<ol>, <ul>, <li>), and forms (<form>).

  The span (<span>) element can be used to format different parts of a block element
  or its contents without splitting up the block element. Span elements (like div
  elements) don't do very much unless they're used in conjunction with CSS.

  Block display elements can be turned into inline display elements (with CSS).

inline:
  Inline display elements, unlike block elements, only take up as much space as
  that they need to, in height as well as width.
  Some properties of inline display elements cannot be changed, their width, for
  example.
  Examples of inline elements; span tag (<span>), image tag (<img>), anchor tags (<a>).

  Inline display elements can be turned into block display elements (with CSS).

inline-block:
  Inline-block display elements are a combination of inline and block display
  elements.

none:
  Using 'display: none' on an element removes that element from the web page.
  The code for the element will still be there, but in terms of how it is displayed
  on the web page, it will have disappeared. The surrounding elements, if Inline
  display elements, will take the place of those that have a display property of
  'none'.
  Similarly, the 'visibility' property can hide (with the value of 'hidden') a
  an element from view, but it will remain in its position on the web page, it
  just looks as if there is a gap, the element just can't be seen.
