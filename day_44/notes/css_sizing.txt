CSS Sizing

There are 3 types of sizing values for fonts; pixels (px), as a percentage (%),
or em (or rem).

em is the phonetic pronunciation of the letter 'm'. In older days, in computer
text, each symbol (letters, numbers, etc) had the spacing of a capital M. This is
what em meant, although it doesn't happen currently.

rem is short for 'root em'.It is one of the font-relative measurement units
commonly used in css.

All 3 measurements can be converted to each other.
1em (or 1rem) = 16px
