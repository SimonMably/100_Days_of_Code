Using the requests Module

Types of requests:
- GET: requests.get()  *
- POST: requests.post()
- PUT: requests.put()
- DELETE: requests.delete()

* Parameters go inside the parentheses

For a GET request, we make a request to an external system (through an API), and we
receive a response in return.
For the other types of requests, the code is similar:
POST: A post request is where we give an external system a piece of data while not
      being particularly interested in the response other than to see if the post
      request was successful or not. For example, if we wanted to save a piece of data
      in a Google Sheets document, we could use the Google Sheets API to POST the data
      to the Google Sheet.

PUT:  A put request is where we can update a piece of data in an external system.
      For example, if we had a spreadsheet in Google Sheets with values that we
      wanted to update, we can use a PUT request to do this.

DELETE: A delete request is where we delete some data in a external system. For
        Example, deleting an existing Tweet or Facebook post.
