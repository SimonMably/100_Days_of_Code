API = Application Programming Interface

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of commands, functions,
protocols and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact
with an external system.

API's act as a interface/barrier between our programs and an external system.
Our programs can use the rules that the APIs have prescribed to make a
request to the external system for some data. If the request has been
structured correctly, according to the requirements that the external
system has set out in their API, then they will respond to our programs
appropriately and give the requested data.

Restaurant Analogy:
A customer (the program) <-> menu/waiter/waitress (the API) <-> kitchen (external system)
- The customer (the program) looks through the the menu (API 1/2) which
  tells the customer what they can order, the customer tells the
  waiter/waitress (API 2/2) what they would like to order (the request),
  the waiter/waitress takes customer order to the kitchen (the external
  system) where the chefs make the customers food (the requested data). When
  the food is done, the waiter/waitress takes food to the customers (the response).

Sevices that use APIs:
- Websites/apps that display the weather forecast
  Example: Yahoo! weather (displays the current weather and a 7 day forecast of user
                           entered location.

- Websites/apps that display the current market value and other relevant data of
  various Cryptocurrencies
  Example: coinbase

- Websites/apps that display the stats and other relevant information of famous
  people who play sports.
  Example: the NBA website (displays stats for basketball players)
