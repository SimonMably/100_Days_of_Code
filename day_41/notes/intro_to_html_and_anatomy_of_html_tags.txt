Introduction to HTML

HTML is the foundation to all websites. Websites cannot be made with just CSS or
just JavaScript, but they can be made with just HTML.

Website made with just HTML will not look great by modern standards. They look
like they came from the 1990's, but HTML does enable a website to display text
or various elements such as images, text, forms and tables depending on how the
HTML file is coded.

HTML = HyperText Markup Language

HTML is a Markup language (similar to XML (Extensible Markup Language) and
GML (Generalised Markup Language))

Markup Languages share a common history. They are based on the markup that used
to be put into manuscripts where editors would mark up the manuscripts and either
changes to the author or specify structure and layout to the publishers.


The Anatomy of an HTML Tag (or element)

<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h1></h1> is a headings tag (the largest).

<h1> is the opening/start tag. </h1> is the closing/end tag. The text in between
the start and end tags is the content that we want the tag (or structure) to be
applied to. (THIS TYPE OF TAG REQUIRES A CLOSING TAG)

Another type of tag is the "self-closing tag". For example, <br> ((line) break tag).
A self-closing tag doesn't need a closing tag (eg. </br>).
Another example of a self-closing tag is the <hr> tag (horizontal rule).

Modifying Tags/Elements with Attributes

Inside tags, the HTML element comes first, then the HTML Attribute. For example:
<hr size="3">





Example HTML code:

<center>
<hr size="3" noshade>
<h1>The Adventures of<br>Sherlock Holmes</h1>
<br>
<h3>by</h3>
<br>
<h2>Arthur Conan Doyle</h2>
<hr size="3" noshade>
</center>
