The Anatomy of CSS Syntax


CSS Syntax is the grammar of the CSS language.

What CSS syntax looks like:
selector {property: value;}

The curly braces and the semi-colon are expected as they are apart of the CSS syntax.

selector = what we want to modify, eg. the paragraph (<p>) tag, the image (<img>)
           tag.

property = what selector property we want to modify, eg. the selectors background
           colour, the selectors text colour, the selectors position.

value = the how we want tot modify the selector. eg. make the selector blue or red.
        What value will we give the selector to change it.

 Example CSS:
 h1{color: red;}

 h1 = selector
 color = property
 red = value

 We can have multiple modifications to the selector. eg.
 selector {property: value; property: value; property: value;}

 Having multiple modifications to each selector means that it will run out of
 room on the line it's on, so we can instead have each modification on its own line.
 eg.
selector {
  color: red;
  font-size: 15px;
 }
 This is considered a best practice. Another best practice is to list the
 modifications alphabetically (by property) so each modification is easier to
 find.

For the properties we can change, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference
for reference.

Use tag selectors to change the properties of all instances of a particular tag.
eg.
h1 {
color: red;
font-size: 30px;
}

Use class selectors to change the properties of a single/particular tag. Use the
class property inside of the tag first, then change the property in CSS. Can have
as many instances of the same class (name) as we want. Use to style a group
of items.
eg.
1. in HTML file:
<img class="bacon" src="bacon.png" alt="bacon-img">

2. Using class selector to change the property:
.bacon {
  background-color: green;
}

Can also use id selectors to change the properties of a single/particular tag. Use the
id property inside of the tag first, then change the property in CSS. Can only
have one instance of an id selector (eg. only 1 id="heading"). Use to style a
specific element (we can have multiple ids on the same web page, we just can't
use each one more than once on the same page).
eg.
1. in HTML file:
<h1 id="heading">

2. Using class selector to change the property:
#heading {
  background-color: blue;
}


pseudo-classes:
Use pseudo-classes to change state of an element. pseudo-classes will have a
colon in the front of them.
eg.
img:hover {
  background-color: blue:
}
