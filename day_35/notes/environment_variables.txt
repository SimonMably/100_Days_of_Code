Environment Variables

What are they used for:
There are 2 major use cases:
- Convenience:
    Normally, when we deploy a large application, the process is quite complicated.
    When we've done it, we don't want to mess around with the codebase and update
    the information stored in variables.

    Instead, we can have Environment Variables that we can change. For example, if
    we had an application that regularly sends emails to clients, our client's
    emails may change from day to day. These emails can be stored as Environment
    Variables so they can be changed as and when needed very easily without
    touching the code.

- Security:
    When we develop software, we may be uploading our codebase somewhere (like
    storing it online for people to see or storing it on a cloud service for
    example). It's generally not a good idea to leave API keys, authentication keys
    and other sensitive information in a codebase that other people can see it.

There are some ways to store Environment Variables (eg. on a cloud service or within
our codebase). From within our codebase, for example, we can store Environment
Variables within .env files
