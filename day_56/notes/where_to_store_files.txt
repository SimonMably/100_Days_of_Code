When creating a Flask application, we need to make 2 sub-directories inside the main directory. They need to be named
"static" and "templates". All HTML files need to be stored in the "templates" folder and CSS files, images, videos and
any other static files need to be stored in the "static" folder. Remember, the file path is relative to that folder.
