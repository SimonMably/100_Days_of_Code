About the Command line/Terminal

The Command Line (or Terminal) is a way typing in commands one line at a time in order to control our computer. The
command Line is also known as the Shell.

Pistachio Nut Analogy
If an Operating System is a pistachio nut, the actual nut is the Kernel. In computing, the Kernel refers to the actual
program that interfaces with the hardware, so it's the core of the Operating System.
The Shell refers to the User Interface for user to be able to interact with the Kernel, and in turn the hardware of a
computer.

There are 2 variants to the shell:
    - GUI Shells - An example of a GUI Shell is 'File Explorer' (on Windows) which gives a graphical
      way of accessing and finding directories and files.
    - Command Line Interface - A text based Shell of the above.


Why Use the Command Line?
At the end of the day, it all boils down to 'greater control'. I our journey to become a better developer, we will need
to understand and exert more power over our tools that is computer hardware. But on a day to day basis, we will find,
if we are a regular Command Line user, that it's actually easier and faster to do a lot of common things.
