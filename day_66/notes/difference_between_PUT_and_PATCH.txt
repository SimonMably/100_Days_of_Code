The Difference Between PUT and PATCH

PUT:
Updating an entry by replacing it with an entirely new entry. The entire entry
gets updated (or replaced).

PATCH:
Only sends the piece of data that needs to be updated. Instead of the entire
entry, PATCH just updates the exact thing that needs to be updated.
