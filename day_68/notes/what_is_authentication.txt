What is Authentication


Why Authenticate?

1. Websites allow users to post data on their websites. This user posted data will
   include things like blog post, images, videos, comments, likes and upvotes, etc.
   Authentication will give users an "id", like an account that they can log into
   with a username and password. Users will then be able to use this authentication
   to associate their accounts with their posted data.

2. Authentication also allows websites to restrict access to certain areas of their
   websites depending of the status of each individual user.
   For example, Spotify and Netflix charge their users for some or all of their
   content for users to access. Once users pay, Spotify and Netflix will have to
   update the users account in their databases to say that these users have paid
   and the users will be allowed to access the show/films and songs that they're
   entitled to.


Authentication can be done in a number of ways. Creating a website where we sign up
and log in users seems simple enough, but the difficult part of authentication
comes from how secure the website will be.
