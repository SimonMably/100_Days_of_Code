Hacking Passwords

The same password always turns into the same hash, no matter how many times it's tried. This means that if
multiple users on the same website have the same password, these users will have identical hashes as well.

If a hacker got hold of a bunch of users hashed passwords and noticed that multiple users have the same hash
(meaning they have the same password), the hacker could construct what is known as a hash table.

A hacker would take some of the most commonly used passwords and would use the same hash function create the hash
value for each of those passwords. Below are some of the common passwords that some people like to use.

------------|----------------------------------|
Password    |      Hash                        |
------------|----------------------------------|
   123456   | e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e |
------------|----------------------------------|
   qwerty   | d8578edf8458cd06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4 |
------------|----------------------------------|
  password  | 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 |
------------|----------------------------------|
   111111   | 96e79218965eb72c92a549dd5a330112 |
------------|----------------------------------|

Hackers generate hash tables like this and then they look hash of the user and and compare it against the hashes
they have in their hash table.


Making a Hash Table

What if users didn't use one of the most common passwords and used something else (eg. date of birth, a pets name)?

- All words from a dictionary (150,000 hashes) - This is where the term "dictionary attack" comes from.

- All numbers from a telephone book (5,000,000 hashes)

- All combinations of characters up to 6 places (19,770,609,664 hashes)


How long would it take for a hackers computer to calculate as many as 19,770,609,664 hashes?

The latest computer GPUs and graphics cards are capable of parallel processing and therefore are particularly
suited to not only Bitcoin mining, but also generating hashes.
With one of the latest GPS, a hacker can calculate about 20 billion MD5 hashes per second. So, with one of these
GPUs, it can take a hacker 0.9 seconds to generate 19,770,609,664 hashes.
Whats worse, since a lot of companies have already been hacked, hackers know a lot of the common passwords in use.
There are also pre-built hash tables that people have created for the top 10,000 most common passwords. MD5 hashes
are one of the quickest types of hashes to calculate.


Hash table are very common. Even Google can be used to search for a hashes corresponding password (typically for
common passwords).
For hashes/passwords not turn up in Google Searches, hash tables, or hashes that can't be cracked easily, we need
long passwords that contain a combination of numbers, lower and upper case letters and various other characters.
