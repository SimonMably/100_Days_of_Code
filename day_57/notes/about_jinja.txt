Jinja documentation: https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/

Jinja is a templating language for Python that has a similar syntax to Python.
Jinja allows us to use this syntax (eg, {% code %} and {{ code }}) in order to specify,
inside the HTML file, which parts should be evaluated as Python code.

Examples:
In Python file:

@app.route
def home():
    random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
    return render_template("index.html", num=random_number)


In HTML file:

<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h2>{{ 5 * 6 }}</h2>
    <h3>Random Number: {{ num }}</h3>
</body>

In this example, we use random.randint() to get a random number and store it in a
variable, we pass this variable in 'render_template()' as the 'num' keyword argument
(render_template() allows us to use **kwargs). 'num' gets used in the HTML file (in
the <h3> tag and this will be displayed on the webpage the browser as a random number.
Also, the HTML files <h2> tag contains {{ 5 * 6 }}. This will be seen as an equation
and will display the answer in the webpage in the browser (without the curly braces,
'5 * 6' will be displayed on the webpage).
