URL building is a way that allows us to direct the user to a specific page on a website or web app.
To build a URL to a specific function, we can use the 'use_for()' function. use_for() takes the name of the function
that routes to a specific webpage as the first argument and then can take **kwargs after.
Documentation for URL building can be found at: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/#url-building

We can use Jinja to accomplish this on the HTML side of things.
Example:
<a href="{{ url_for('get_blog', num=3) }}">Go to blog</a>
                       ^          ^
                       |          |
      parameter of function       **kwarg
      associated with webpage

The above example will generate a hyperlink to the webpage associated with the 'get_blog()' function. The 'num=3' **kwarg
will need to be caught in the 'app.route()' decorator as 'app.route("/blog/<num>")' and will also need to be used as
the input of the function itself.

The URL of this particular link is: http://127.0.0.1:5000/blog/3
