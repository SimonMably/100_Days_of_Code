JSON Files

JSON = JavaScript Object Notation

Originally designed for Javascript, it has been adopted by many other programming
languages because of how simple and easy it is to use.
It is one of the most popular ways of transfering data, especially over the internet.
JSON is essentially made up of nest lists and dictionaries (as it looks very similar or even the same to Python dictionaries).

To work with JSON data in Python, we can use the in-built JSON library. We can use this JSON library to access and write to JSON files with: 
    - json.dump() -- Write
    - json.read() -- Read
    - json.update() -- Update
