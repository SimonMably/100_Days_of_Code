Wireframes are a low fidelity representation of the design of a website or app. 
Creating a wireframe is meant to be done with using a pencil and paper (website 
variants are available) and is supposed to be quick and simple.

The idea behind creating a wireframe is to settle on the design of a website or
how the website should before creating the actual website itself. 


The opposite of a wireframe is called a "Mock-up". A Mock-up is a high-fidelity 
representation of the desig of a website or app. Mock-ups are like we've gone 
to the future, taken a screenshot of the website/app while it's in action and 
brought that screenshot back to the present to show people what it looks like. 

One the good things about Mock-ups is that what you see in the Mock-up is what
you get in the final website/app.

Steps to take to desig in a website/app:
1. Choose design patterns (eg. a carousel design pattern or a slideshow)
   Look at www.ui-patterns.com for different types and examples of design 
   patterns. 

2. A simple sketched Wireframe.
   For planning the layout and seeing where everything is going to be.

3. Create a Mock-up (optional).
   Mock-ups can be made with software like PhotoShop or Illustrator 

4. Create a prototype (optional, to go the extra mile).
   An animated version of a website/app.
