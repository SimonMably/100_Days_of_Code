When we try to access/request a website from a server over the internet, we do 
it via underground and underwater cables. When we make the request, the server 
can be anywhere in the world and there can be a delay.

This is where a Content Delivery Network (CDN) comes in. If a website is hosted on a server in a single location, a CDN will find the shortest route
possible (via underground/water cables) from the browser making the request to
the server hosting the website. This cuts down the latency or the amount of time it takes for a website to load in the browser.

Bootstrap host their Bootstrap CSS files on "Maxcdn", which have a number of 
routing points across the world.
