Advanced CSS - Media Query Breakpoints (or Media Queries)

Making sure that our websites are compatible on mobile phones and tablets.

More and more people are browsing the web on mobile phones and tablets. It's a
good idea to make websites mobile friendly.

Options to make websites mobile friendly:
1. Do nothing
    If a website is not mobile friendly, looking through such a site
    would not be a good experience for users. Also, non-mobile-friendly
    sites don't rank too high in Google searches (they appear on the
    2nd Google search page or beyond, which not many people go to).

2. Make a separate mobile site
    Many large companies have a separate mobile site that redirects users to if
    they are using a mobile phone or a tablet to browse their website (a separate
    site is not the same as an app). These mobile specific sites are created
    specifically for mobile use.

3. Make the website responsive
    Arguably the best option, making a website responsive so it can adapt to
    whatever device is used.


How Media Queries are Structured

@media <type> <feature>

@media: keyword, this means that everything after the @media keyword is a
        Media Query.

<type>: type of media or medium that we are selecting on. eg, if the code is
        being displayed on a screen or is being printed if it's on a screen
        reader, etc.

<feature>: this checks to see if the Media Query is true or false.
