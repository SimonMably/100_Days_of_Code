Bootstrap is a front-end library.


Front-end and back-end
- The front end is the what users will see: the website or mobile app.
- The back end is the behind-the-scenes business logic that resides on a server 
  and handles how the website/mobile app works and things it has to do (the 
  ovarall functionality of the website/app). 

There are a number of programming languages associated with the front-end and 
back-end.
For the front-end: HTML, CSS, and javascript.
For the back-end: .NET, Ruby, PHP, NodeJS, Java, Python, SQL (for databases).

Bootstrap is for the front-end. It's a bunch of code that was written to be
reusable, that can be dropped in to a site and make designing a website much 
easier. 

Bootstrap was originally developed by Twitter to get more consistance across 
websites that they design. Since then, Twitter has made Bootstrap free and 
open-source (Bootstraps source code can be accessed on GitHub).

Bootstrap makes it easier to make websites and apps more responive and adaptable.
Bootstrap also gives programmers access to pre-styled elements that can be 
dropped into our code with minimal effort.
