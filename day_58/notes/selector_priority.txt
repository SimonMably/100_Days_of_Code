Selector Priority

If change the same property twice for a particular element, the first property
change would be overwritten by the second property change.

For example:
<h1 id="heading" class="title">Hello World</h1>

h1 {
    color: red;
    color: green;
}

In the above example, changing the 'color' property to green will overwrite the
property change to red because it comes second in order (or in this case, last).
In this case, the last CSS rule has priority over everything above it.

It would be better to use classes to change an elements properties as they are
more specific. Also, using the class of the above <h1> to change its 'color'
property will override the above CSS styling.

.title {
    color: yellow;
}

Using an elements id to change the elements properties has an even higher
priority.

#heading {
    color: blue;
}

Finally, using inline styles to change an elements properties has the highest
priority and overrides all the external styling on the same element propertiess.

<h1 id="heading" class="title" style="color: orange;">Hello World</h1>


How to avoid conflicting rules:

Doing all the above at once is very inefficient and prone to bugs and errors.

Steps to take to avoid conflicting rules:
1. Use ids sparingly. Don't us an id unless something absolutely needs it.
   Otherwise, use a class.

2. When applying a class to an element, it's best tot use just 1 class (bootstrap
   likes to use classes though, which irks some people).

3. Avoid inline styles at all costs. There are no cases where inline styles
   can't be solve by external style sheets. It is seen as bad CSS coding
   practice and lazy.
