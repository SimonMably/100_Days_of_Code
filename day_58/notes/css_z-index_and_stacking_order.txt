Z-Index

Each element on screen has an x-position and a y-position, so we can move the
element upwards, downward and left and right. Elements also have a z-position
(or a z-index). The z-position has to do with getting closer to the screen or
getting further away from the screen (or being in front of something or behind).

So, if we want to make element 1 to go behind element 2, we have to set the
z-position of element 1 to be lower than the z-position of element 2 (or higher
if we want element 1 in front of element 2).

Each elements default z-position is 0.

For example, if we have a red div, a yellow div and a blue div, they have the
default z-position of 0, they would appear in a straight vertical line. But, if
we gave the red dive the z-position of 1, the red and yellow divs would be in
the same place in terms of x and y positions, but because of the red divs
z-position, it would look like it is place in front of the yellow div and the
blue div would still be underneath them. This only works if the position property
of these divs are set to the default static.
