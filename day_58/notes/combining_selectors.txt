Combining Selectors
- Combining CSS selectors in a stylesheet and applying styles for these
selectors.

2 methods:
Multiple Selectors
- Grouping multiple selectors together if they have the same styles. Selectors
  are separated with a comma (and an optional space).

selector1, selector2 {

}

eg.
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: "Montserrat";
    font-weight: 900;
}

h1, p {
    color: red;
}


Hierarchical Selectors
- Targets a selector that is contained within another selector (a <h1> contained
  within a <div>, for example). To use properly, we need to know how is
  structured. Selectors are separated by a space (which is crucial). Should be
  used to style specific elements. The hierarchy of selectors should be read
  from right to left (the selector on the right is the 'child' and the selector
  on the left is the 'parent'. This only works if a selector is actually a
  'child' of the 'parent').

selector1 selector2 {

}

eg.
The element with the class .container-fluid is contained within the element
with the id of #title.
#title .container-fluid {
    padding-top: 3%;
    text-align: left;
}

div #title {
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
}


Combined Selectors
- Targets specific elements (eg. a <h1> with an id of #title). As opposed to
  hierarchal selectors, combined selectors are read from left to right. Nothing
  should separate them. Can only be used on compatible selectors, eg, if a <div>
  has a class called 'container-fluid'. Cannot work if selectors are 'child' or
  'parent' (Hierarchical Selectors will be needed for this instance). All Selectors
  must be within the same HTML element.

A HTML element combined with a class:
selector1.selector2 {

}

A HTML element combined with an id:
selector1#selector2 {

}

eg.
div.containerfluid {
    padding: 3% 5%;
}

h1#title {
    font-family: "Montserrat";
    font-weight: 900;
    text-align: center;
}
