# Strongly Typed:
# '3 + "4"' cannot be done because Python is a strongly-typed language. This
#  means that Python will not allow each data type to work with other data
#  types as they are incompatible. Also, certain methods and functions will
#  only work on 1 (or so) data type and not others.

# Dynamically Typed:
# This means that we don't need to declare the data type of variables (as
# Python will know the ata type of all variables in a program at run-time).
# Also, we can change the contents of variables whenever we need or want to.
# We can even change data types.

# Example:
# Storing an integer in a variable
a = 3
print(a)

# Changing the same variables contents to a string
a = "Hello"
print(a)
