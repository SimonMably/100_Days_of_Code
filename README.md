# #100 Days of Code

Im taking part in '100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021'
course from Udemy.

Since my goal is to master Python, I chose to take this course in the hope it would provide more structure and better guidance than I was getting while "self-learning".

While taking part in this course, I have been taking notes and what-not and attempting all of the course projects to the best of my abilities.

I'll be using this repo as a way for myself to access them as, if and when I need them.

### Notes

1. **Blackjack Game - Day 11**
 I've been having trouble with the Balckjack capstone project for Day 11. I 
 can't seem to figure out how to implement certain features (mainly the scores) 
 and I don't simply want to copy the solution from the Udemy course. For this 
 reason, I have chosen to come back to Day 11 at a later date when I feel I am 
 capable and have a fresh mind.

1. **Higher Lower Game - Day 14**
 I've notice a recurring theme of having trouble with coming up with my own 
 solutions to big projects. I make an attemt at the Higher Lower Game, but 
 ended up spending a wee having difficulties. I included the solution from the 
 Udemy course into the main file (along with my own attemt). I intent to come 
 back to this project and have another go at attempting it to see if I can 
 complete it on my own.
